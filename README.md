## 📂 Repository Structure
All projects are organized into separate folders for clarity and easy navigation.

### 📊 BidirectionalLSTM_PPOK-detection

  - Deep learning project (BiLSTM + DWT + MFCC) for detecting COPD from lung sound recordings. Built as part of my undergraduate thesis.

### 📊 ECG-EEG-Data-Signal-Analysis
  - Biomedical signal analysis project involving ECG and EEG preprocessing, time–frequency analysis, and physiological feature extraction to compare autonomic and brain activity between two subjects.

### 📊 Image_Processing

  - Classical image processing pipeline for segmenting and measuring acne and rosacea lesion areas based on texture, intensity, and color characteristics.

### 📊 Supervised-learning-model-evaluation_Project

  - Comparison of multiple supervised learning models with feature selection and performance evaluation across four classifiers.

### 📊 Telemedicine-Wireless-Biomedical-Data-Transmission

  - A telemedicine mini-system using ESP8266 + TCP Socket to acquire, transmit, and visualize biomedical signal data (sinusoidal simulation) in real time from embedded client to server.
